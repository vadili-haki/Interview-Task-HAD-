# 📂 Next.js File Explorer – Interview Task

This project is my submission for the *HAD Communications & IT Frontend Interview Task*.  
It is a file explorer built with *Next.js (App Router), **TypeScript, and **Tailwind CSS*.  
Data is stored in-memory on the server.

## ✅ Implemented Features
- Create folders *inside folders* (nested structure).
- Display different file types (e.g., .png, .pdf, .txt).
- Implemented a *“step back”* mechanism to navigate to the parent folder.
- Fixed bug where creating a folder inside a subfolder mistakenly created it in the parent folder.
- Refactored codebase for clarity and maintainability.
- Enhanced design for a *responsive layout* and *optimized file viewing*.
- *Recent Files Page* (optional task).
- Additional improvements:
  - Improved UI styling with Tailwind.
  - Clear folder/file icons.
